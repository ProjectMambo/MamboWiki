# MamboSite

MamboSite is a Markdown-first static site compiler for Project Mambo. It reads a clean repository-local `docs/` tree, uses Rust for parsing and validation, emits typed TypeScript modules and theme CSS, and produces a static Next.js export for deployment to GitHub Pages.

MamboSite does not require Obsidian or prescribe where authors maintain their original notes. Project Mambo uses a separate `sync-docs` workflow to export selected documents from an Obsidian vault into each repository's `docs/` tree.

The initial compiler, React runtime, default theme, Next.js adapter, and `check`, `build`, `init`, and `deploy` commands are implemented. These documents describe both the current schema-1 behavior and the remaining version-0.1 work; planned features are labeled as such.

- [[Theme and Components]] — layouts, responsive behavior, design tokens, and component overrides.

## Configure and operate a site

- [[Build and Deployment]] — configuration, compilation, static export, local preview, and GitHub Pages.
- [[Diagnostics and Testing]] — validation, error reporting, fixtures, and quality gates.
- [[Documentation Sync]] — Project Mambo's optional Obsidian-to-repository export workflow.

## Understand and extend MamboSite

- [[Architecture]] — system boundaries, repositories, packages, and build stages.
- [[Parsing and Resolution]] — Rust parsing pipeline, links, embeds, and assets.
- [[TypeScript Output]] — generated module and runtime contracts.
- [[Roadmap]] — current status, remaining phases, non-goals, and unresolved decisions.

The current milestone covers the MamboFolio and MamboWiki integrations, including validated content-asset publication. Fragment transclusion, advanced collection/gallery views, search, and package publication remain planned.
