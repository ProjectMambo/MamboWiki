# Retrieval

Retrieval turns a query into a ranked list of existing meme items. The user decides which result is useful; the engine does not compose a reply.

## Query contract

The retrieval worker accepts one query string or several alternate search cues. Each cue may describe:

- a person or character: `john cena`;
- a template or title: `distracted boyfriend`;
- a quote or OCR fragment: `you can't see me`;
- a topic or tag: `wrestling`;
- a visual scene: `wrestler waving hand in front of face`;
- a concept: `pretending to be invisible`;
- noisy text: `jon sena invisible meme`.

Multiple cues are OR-style hints. Retrieve each independently and fuse the ranks so one weak cue cannot erase a useful exact match. They are not chat messages and are not averaged into one embedding.

Normalize corpus fields and queries with the same versioned function: Unicode NFKC plus whitespace collapse. Preserve original strings for display. Bound cue count, UTF-8 byte length, result limit, and filter values before storage or model work.

The implemented boundary accepts one to four cues, at most 512 UTF-8 bytes each, and one to fifty results. Exact duplicate normalized cues are collapsed. `kind` accepts `text` or `image`; `language` accepts a simple language tag.

## Search fields

| Field | Best for | Priority |
|---|---|---:|
| Title and aliases | Known meme names and common variants | Highest |
| People and characters | `john cena`, `drake`, `pikachu` | Highest |
| Template | Template identity and grouping | High |
| Quote and corrected OCR | Exact visible wording | High |
| Tags | Topics, slang, franchises, actions | Medium |
| Literal caption | Visual descriptions | Medium |
| Search description | Concepts and paraphrases | Medium |
| Raw OCR | Recall when correction is unavailable | Low |

Generated descriptions must not bury exact identity evidence. Keep fields separate for lexical weights and diagnostics even when the dense route uses a combined field-labelled document.

## Lexical route

SQLite FTS5/BM25 is the mandatory baseline. It should make `john cena` strongly match title, alias, people, template, tags, and OCR fields.

Phase 2 freezes a candidate depth of `100`. Title and people each have weight `12`, template `10`, OCR `8`, tags `5`, and caption, description, and body text `3`. Tokens of four or more characters use an internal prefix term so a noisy partial cue can still recover a candidate. Stable item ID breaks score ties.

The query boundary treats input as plain text, not user-authored FTS grammar:

1. tokenize bounded normalized text;
2. escape and quote every literal token or phrase;
3. build only the supported internal expression;
4. bind that expression as a SQL parameter;
5. apply declared column weights and deterministic tie-breaking.

Do not expose raw `MATCH` operators. Quotes, parentheses, hyphens, Unicode, and empty input are explicit tests.

## Semantic route

Dense text retrieval is an experiment for meaning that lexical terms miss. The implemented Phase 2 route builds log-scaled TF-IDF, applies truncated SVD with at most eight dimensions, canonicalizes component signs, and performs exact cosine search over L2-normalized item vectors with a `0.15` minimum similarity.

For the initial corpus, exact NumPy matrix multiplication is enough. A vector database or approximate-nearest-neighbour index is justified only after the real corpus misses its latency target.

The dense document repeats identity fields more heavily than captions and descriptions. It is a cheap latent-semantic baseline for a tiny local corpus, not a pretrained language model and not a claim of cross-modal understanding.

The first implementation is dense **text-to-text** retrieval. CLIP-style image embeddings are a separate later experiment because their contribution must be measured independently.

## Hybrid ranking

Construct the static and request-specific eligibility mask before ranking: published, available, licensed, safe, and compatible with the requested kind/language filters. Each route searches only that mask. If a backend cannot mask directly, it must over-fetch and refill deterministically until it finds the required eligible depth or exhausts its candidates.

Retrieve a fixed eligible candidate depth from each active cue and route. Fuse their ranks using reciprocal-rank fusion:

```text
RRF(item) = sum(1 / (60 + route_rank) for each cue/route hit)
```

V1 uses equal cue and route weights, candidate depth `100`, and stable-ID tie-breaking. Lexical candidates require a literal FTS match; dense candidates require cosine similarity of at least `0.15`.

After fusion:

1. join canonical metadata and assert every item still satisfies the eligibility mask;
2. collapse exact duplicates;
3. cap repeated variants from one template group;
4. refill from the fused eligible candidates after duplicate/template removal;
5. sort by fused rank, then stable item ID for deterministic ties;
6. return up to the requested limit or exhaust eligible candidates.

Raw BM25, cosine, and fused values are evidence, not probabilities. An empty list is correct when no eligible candidate has sufficient evidence.

## Baselines and ablations

Phase 2 evaluates the first three systems on the same corpus and benchmark:

1. lexical BM25 only;
2. dense text only;
3. lexical plus dense fusion;
4. later: hybrid without each major field when the human benchmark can support useful ablations;
5. later: an image-vector route only when implemented;
6. later: a reranker only after reviewed hard negatives exist.

The hybrid system becomes the default only if it improves semantic/concept searches without materially regressing entity, name, template, or exact-quote searches.

## Phase 2 decision

The public `fixture-provisional-v1` comparison reports holdout macro nDCG@10 of `0.993` for lexical, `0.915` for dense, and `0.999` for hybrid. Hybrid improves the semantic slice by `0.033`, but its overall improvement is only `0.005` and the prompt-family cluster-bootstrap interval is `[0.0, 0.0109]`. It misses both effect-size thresholds and the lower bound is not above zero, so dense fusion is **not accepted as the default**.

The worker therefore announces `lexical` as its default route. `dense` and `hybrid` remain explicit routes so the experiment, degradation behavior, and future corpus comparisons stay reproducible.

## Result presentation

Every ranked result includes enough information for the user and tests to understand it:

| Value | Use |
|---|---|
| Stable ID and rank | Selection, events, reproducibility, and deterministic tests |
| Title, item type, and text | Compact result row |
| Thumbnail or asset URI | Preview and external open |
| People, template, and tags | Identity and quick verification |
| Caption | Portable fallback when inline image display is unavailable |
| Source and attribution | Rights-compliant display |
| Matched fields and routes | Debugging and optional UI explanation |
| Dataset and retriever versions | Reproduce the ranking |

The worker response also includes `truncated`. When a 50-result response would exceed the 16 MiB output-frame bound, it removes tail results deterministically and sets that flag instead of emitting invalid NDJSON.

The Phase 3 TUI requests one cue, the default lexical route, and at most ten results. It validates the result envelope in Rust, shows a ranked list and metadata preview, and returns the explicitly selected stable ID as JSON after restoring the terminal.

Phase 4 does not add another ranking path. A Commons record becomes an ordinary eligible corpus item only after reviewed acquisition, Rust ingestion, and a new Python snapshot publication. Before every search, an already-open engine rechecks `active.json` and requires the snapshot and dataset identities it loaded. Tombstone ingestion removes that pointer, while a later rebuild changes it; either condition fails the old worker closed so removed content cannot remain searchable through an open SQLite handle.

## Interaction feedback

An interaction event may be recorded locally when the user explicitly enables feedback. Its action is one of `open`, `copy`, `choose`, `reformulate`, or `abandon`. Highlight/preview movement is not logged. `open` is recorded only after the platform opener launches, although the later viewer outcome is unknowable. `copy` records the manual-copy notice because v1 does not write to the clipboard. Only `choose` is the v1 success signal.

Events use schema version `1` and one JSON object per line at `<data-dir>/feedback/interaction-events.jsonl`. Each object contains exactly:

```text
schema_version, event_id, session_id, timestamp_unix_ms,
request_id, query, returned[{id, rank}], action,
target_id, shown_rank, dataset_version, retriever_version,
interface_version, elapsed_since_render_ms
```

`returned` is the ordered worker result list, not proof that every row was visible or inspected. `target_id` and `shown_rank` are null for untargeted actions; `shown_rank` is the target's returned-list rank. `interface_version` is `tui-v1`; IDs are random launch/event identifiers rather than user identifiers.

The initial privacy contract is:

- logging is off by default, and disabling it stops new writes immediately;
- events stay in one owner-readable/writable local file with mode `0600` where the platform supports it;
- the trimmed submitted query is stored only when feedback was enabled for that search; hashing a low-entropy query is not anonymization;
- one random session ID is created per launch and is never reused as a user identity;
- events expire after 30 days by default and the user can delete the file immediately;
- no event contains chat context, clipboard contents, machine identity, or a stable user ID;
- nothing is uploaded without a separate explicit export/upload action and consent.

The directory and file use owner-only `0700` and `0600` permissions on Unix. Expired-event cleanup is attempted on every TUI launch, whenever logging is enabled, and before inspection. A malformed log disables capture and shows a notice without blocking search. `mambomeme feedback inspect --data-dir DIR` prints valid local records and `mambomeme feedback delete --data-dir DIR` removes the file immediately.

Selection is biased by rank, exposure, popularity, familiarity, and preview quality. Therefore:

- report `choose` and the diagnostic actions as observational product data over returned rankings, not benchmark truth or exposure evidence;
- do not update live rankings directly from raw selections;
- use reviewed selections for hard-negative analysis first;
- require randomized or interleaved exposure with logged propensities before causal click-learning claims;
- gate every later learned ranker against the frozen human-labelled benchmark.

## Scaling triggers

| Add | Only when |
|---|---|
| Approximate vector index | Exact dense search fails the real p95 latency gate. |
| Vector database | Concurrent remote clients, shared writes, or filtering requirements exceed local artifacts. |
| Learned reranker | Enough reviewed query-item pairs and hard negatives exist. |
| Image embeddings | The visual-description slice shows a measured text-only gap. |
| PyO3 | Profiling finds a fine-grained CPU hotspot that batching or native libraries cannot remove. |
| Network service | The Rust interface and Python worker must deploy or scale independently. |
