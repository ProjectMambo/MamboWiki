# Roadmap

MamboMeme is built in four substantial phases. Each phase leaves a useful, executable system and closes only after its acceptance checks pass. Context-aware suggestions remain future work outside these four phases.

Phases 1 through 3 are complete. The repository has the local corpus, ranked retrieval, evaluator, long-lived worker, Rust TUI, optional private feedback, PTY acceptance path, and interface profile. Phase 4's single approved Wikimedia Commons source is in progress.

## Phase 1: Executable local corpus

**Status: complete.** Closed with deterministic local ingestion and publication, ten Rust tests, ten Python tests, Clippy with warnings denied, and the offline cross-language fixture.

This phase combines the former contract and data-vertical-slice phases. It establishes the durable boundary that every later feature consumes.

Deliver:

- one Cargo package and one Python package, with no service or plugin framework;
- versioned source-envelope, SQL, snapshot-manifest, normalization, and outcome contracts;
- a small redistributable fixture containing text and image items, exact duplicate content, and a rights-invalid quarantine case;
- one Rust `ingest` command for bounded local JSON Lines records and static images;
- local-path containment, bounded static PPM decoding and dimension checks, rights validation, content hashing, exact deduplication, provenance, explicit outcomes, and content-addressed media storage;
- ordered SQLite migrations, idempotent whole-manifest transactions that roll back every canonical change, and an unresolved-manifest gate that fails closed after interruption or fatal failure;
- one Python `build_index` command that builds deterministic fielded FTS5, validates integrity and serving coverage, checksums the snapshot, and atomically publishes `active.json`;
- Rust and Python tests for the fixture, invalid inputs, reruns, deterministic output, and publication rollback.

Phase 1 deliberately excludes OCR/model calls, embeddings, search APIs, the worker protocol, the TUI, and network acquisition.

Exit when:

1. the documented commands run from a clean checkout;
2. two imports preserve canonical IDs and item counts while producing the documented accepted/duplicate then unchanged outcomes;
3. the duplicate retains provenance without creating another searchable item;
4. the invalid-rights record remains quarantined and outside FTS;
5. two builds produce the same canonical content identity and search rows;
6. a failed candidate build leaves the active snapshot unchanged;
7. all Phase 1 Rust and Python tests pass offline.

## Phase 2: Ranked retrieval and evaluation

**Status: complete.** Closed with twelve Rust tests, twenty-seven Python tests, the offline Phase 2 fixture, Clippy with warnings denied, and a versioned provisional comparison report.

Build the complete headless search engine on the published Phase 1 corpus.

Deliver in this order:

1. a Python BM25 baseline over the fielded FTS index for people, template names, tags, and quote fragments;
2. query validation, eligibility filters, duplicate/template handling, deterministic ties, and correct empty results;
3. a repository-visible provisional development/holdout benchmark, evaluator tests, latency and memory measurements, and score-readiness report;
4. a TF-IDF/LSA dense text baseline for semantic and visual-description queries;
5. deterministic hybrid fusion and a three-route comparison against the same benchmark;
6. the long-lived, versioned NDJSON worker with a ready handshake, one in-flight query, typed framing errors, and clean shutdown.

The worker returns reproducible ranked results. On `fixture-provisional-v1`, hybrid improves overall nDCG@10 by `0.005` and the semantic slice by `0.033`, with a prompt-family bootstrap interval of `[0.0, 0.0109]`; therefore it fails the acceptance rule and lexical search ships as the default. Dense and hybrid remain explicit experimental routes. Field ablations wait for the larger human-labelled benchmark, where they can answer a real error-analysis question.

MMTS-Search-v1 remains `INCOMPLETE`, not `PASS`: Phase 2 has neither the required human-labelled safety/adversarial subset nor Rust TUI submit-to-render latency. The implemented evaluator refuses to manufacture an aggregate score from those missing inputs.

Image embeddings, approximate-nearest-neighbour indexes, a vector database, and a learned reranker are not Phase 2 defaults. Add an experiment only when error analysis identifies a specific gap.

## Phase 3: Rust TUI and first release

**Status: complete.** Closed as a source release with twenty-eight Rust tests, twenty-seven Python unit tests, the Phase 1–3 offline fixtures, Clippy with warnings denied, PTY restoration on success and fatal-worker paths, and a versioned 1,024-measurement interface profile.

Complete the user workflow without changing retrieval ownership.

Deliver:

- a Ratatui interface for query input, ranked results, preview, navigation, open/copy/select, empty results, and typed errors;
- one Python worker per TUI session with bounded startup, query, restart, and shutdown behavior;
- portable text and metadata previews, with inline images only if one maintained adapter proves reliable;
- deterministic state and rendering tests plus PTY terminal-restoration smoke tests;
- opt-in local interaction-event capture, inspection, immediate disable, retention, and deletion;
- end-to-end submit-to-render measurements and the complete fixture selection path;
- a reproducible interface score-readiness report, source-release commands, and usage documentation.

The implemented TUI uses portable metadata previews rather than inline images and exposes copy material in a notice rather than writing to the platform clipboard. One worker is reused per session; protocol waits are five seconds and a fatal state offers at most one deliberate restart.

Phase 3 exits when a user can launch MamboMeme from source, search the fixture, inspect ranked items, explicitly select the expected stable ID, and quit through success and fatal-worker paths without terminal corruption; the latency and reliability interface gates must pass. It does **not** require or claim a complete MMTS-Search-v1 score: that score remains null and `INCOMPLETE` until an independent human-labelled hidden benchmark with its safety subset exists. This replaces the earlier contradictory requirement to pass gates whose required labels were absent.

The checked-in release-mode `80×24` PTY profile reports `75.121 ms` worker startup, `10.569/11.377/11.668 ms` p50/p95/p99 submit-to-completed-result-state latency, and zero request errors. These figures are regression evidence for the declared local boundary, not physical key-to-emulator-paint or universal hardware evidence.

Mouse support, themes, a GUI, uploaded telemetry, and context-aware replies do not block the release.

## Phase 4: One approved external source

**Status: in progress.**

Replace the local-only acquisition boundary with one real, policy-reviewed source while preserving the same canonical corpus contract.

Deliver:

- one finite human-reviewed Wikimedia Commons page-ID plan, without a category crawler or generic adapter hierarchy;
- documented API/automation permission, retention, redistribution, attribution, indexing, deletion, and takedown rules;
- fixed Action API and original-media hosts, pinned-address requests, redirect validation, response limits, serial rate behavior, bounded retries, and a durable plan-hash cursor;
- per-item pinned content, identity, dimensions, licence, attribution, safety, and search/display metadata;
- explicit version-2 tombstones, complete-scan plan reconciliation, active-pointer invalidation, and stale-worker rejection;
- bounded static JPEG/PNG validation; no OCR or generated annotation because this reviewed source slice does not need it;
- corpus freshness, deletion lag, throughput, failure, and resource reports;
- offline network-boundary tests using a controlled local server and resolver stub.

Exit when interruption and rerun cannot duplicate or skip serving records, one bad item cannot lose the batch, omissions and partial scans cannot invent deletions, a rights or permission change removes an item predictably, an open worker cannot serve the invalidated snapshot, and the enlarged corpus still passes retrieval, safety, latency, and integrity gates.

The source contract and policy are documented in [Wikimedia Commons source](Wikimedia%20Commons%20Source.md). Do not mark this phase complete until the full release checks and versioned source report are recorded there and in [Testing](Testing.md).

Extract shared source-adapter code only after a second approved source exposes real duplication.

## Closing a phase

Every phase closes with the same small release discipline:

1. run that phase's acceptance commands and record the result;
2. update the canonical MamboMeme documents with implemented behavior, measured results, and remaining boundaries;
3. sync the canonical documents into the MamboMeme repository;
4. review the generated documentation diff alongside the implementation diff;
5. commit one coherent phase result and push `main`.

Do not mark a phase complete, sync aspirational behavior as current, or begin scaffolding the next phase before the current acceptance checks pass.

## Future: Context-aware suggestions

This remains a separate product iteration. It accepts either one sentence or a bounded sequence of role-labelled messages and derives search cues for the existing retrieval contract.

Compare the smallest approaches in order:

1. search only the latest message;
2. search a bounded concatenation of recent role-labelled messages;
3. use one model call to derive several short search cues, then run normal retrieval.

Keep the cheapest approach that wins a separate blind usefulness evaluation. Context stays ephemeral by default, never enters selection telemetry, and requires its own privacy, prompt-injection, safety, latency, and conversation-boundary tests.

Do not create context modules, prompts, storage, or benchmark files during the four implementation phases.

## Decisions made now

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Search and rank existing items | Matches the actual user workflow and creates a testable retrieval task. |
| User chooses the result | Ranking assists discovery; it does not generate or send a reply. |
| Rust owns ingestion and the TUI | Uses Rust for source boundaries, terminal lifecycle, and systems practice. |
| Python owns indexing, retrieval, and evaluation | Keeps FTS, models, embeddings, evaluation, and one ranking implementation together. |
| NDJSON subprocess boundary | Loads Python once without adding HTTP, FFI, or duplicate services. |
| BM25 before semantic search | Exact entity, name, and quote search is the mandatory baseline. |
| Hybrid only if measured | Dense retrieval must earn its latency and complexity. |
| Exact NumPy scan first | It is sufficient at portfolio scale until measured otherwise. |
| Selection feedback is offline evidence | Raw behavior is biased and cannot safely self-train a ranker. |
| Context is future work | It is a different task built on top of working search. |

## Upgrade triggers

| Add | Trigger |
|---|---|
| Tokio or async ingestion | Measured permitted concurrency improves real source throughput. |
| Approximate vector index | Exact dense search fails the real latency gate. |
| PostgreSQL or a vector service | Concurrent remote users and shared writes require them. |
| PyO3 | A profiled fine-grained boundary dominates after batching. |
| HTTP service | Rust and Python must deploy or scale independently. |
| GUI | Terminal preview, clipboard, or accessibility needs limit real users. |
| Background queue | One resumable process cannot handle the real corpus workflow. |
