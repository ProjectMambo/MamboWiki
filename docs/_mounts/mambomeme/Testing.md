# Testing

Tests cover every documented input partition, state transition, failure boundary, and publication invariant. “All cases” means all contract classes below, not every possible query string or image byte sequence.

## Test layers

| Layer | Purpose | Initial tool |
|---|---|---|
| Rust unit tests | Parsing, limits, outcomes, protocol types, and TUI state | Built-in `cargo test` |
| Python unit tests | Normalization, retrieval, fusion, filters, evaluator math, and manifests | Standard-library `unittest` |
| Contract tests | Rust/Python NDJSON messages and shared SQL migrations | Golden JSON Lines and a fixture database |
| Integration tests | Acquisition, enrichment, index build, publication, and rollback | Local fixture source with no network |
| TUI tests | Screen states, keys, selection, resize, and errors | Ratatui `TestBackend` plus one PTY smoke test |
| End-to-end test | Source through user selection | One small cleared fixture corpus |
| Performance tests | Latency, throughput, memory, size, and regressions | Fixed hardware profile and benchmark queries |

Do not add a large test framework before the built-in runners become insufficient. Test data must be tiny, deterministic, redistributable, and free of production or private feedback records.

## Phase ownership

| Phase | Test ownership |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 — executable local corpus | Local parsing and paths, static-image validation, rights, hashes, exact deduplication, provenance, SQL migrations, FTS construction, checksums, idempotence, and publication rollback |
| Phase 2 — retrieval and evaluation | Query validation, BM25, dense experiment, hybrid fusion, filters, protocol, evaluator math, benchmark integrity, retrieval latency, and error analysis |
| Phase 3 — TUI and release | State/rendering, keys, preview and explicit selection, worker lifecycle, interaction events, PTY restoration, submit-to-render latency, and full end to end |
| Phase 4 — approved external source | URL and address policy, redirects, HTTP limits, retries, cursor resume, source updates/deletions, throughput, and deletion lag |

Tests are added in their owning phase. Phases 1 through 3 are implemented; Phase 4's controlled network and tombstone cases are in progress. The independent human-labelled hidden benchmark remains a future contract.

## Implemented commands

Run the built-in suites from the repository root:

```sh
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
PYTHONPATH=python python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/python
```

Run the complete Phase 1 corpus path and Phase 2 retrieval path:

```sh
python3 tests/test_phase1.py
python3 tests/test_phase2.py
PYTHONPATH=python python3 tests/test_phase3.py
python3 tests/test_phase4.py
```

The acceptance scripts create isolated temporary directories. Phase 1 imports twice, publishes, checks the FTS row for `john cena`, and proves deterministic corpus identity. Phase 2 imports, builds FTS/LSA artifacts, searches `john cena`, evaluates all three routes, exercises the real worker handshake/search/shutdown sequence, and removes the data. Phase 3 builds the Rust binary, launches the real TUI in an `80×24` PTY, selects the expected stable ID, inspects and deletes an opted-in event, proves immediate feedback disable and malformed-log isolation, exercises a fatal worker-output path, verifies terminal restoration, and produces success and all-error 1,024-measurement interface profiles. Phase 4 extends the offline fixture through a Commons-shaped version-2 record, publication, search, tombstone ingestion, stale-worker rejection, rebuild, and confirmed removal.

At Phase 3 close these commands pass with twenty-eight Rust tests and twenty-seven Python unit tests. Phase 4's final count and report are recorded only after its full acceptance run. Clippy runs with warnings denied; all standalone acceptance scripts remain offline. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, Python byte-compilation, and `git diff --check` are release hygiene checks.

## Ingestion matrix — Phases 1 and 4

| Area | Cases |
|---|---|
| Record schema | Valid text; valid image; missing required field; Phase 1 unknown-field quarantine; unknown kind; unsupported schema version; oversized record; invalid UTF-8 input |
| Local paths | Valid file below root; `..` escape; absolute escape; symlink escape; missing file; permission failure |
| Network boundary | Allowed host/address; unsupported scheme; forbidden host; loopback/private/link-local address; DNS change; redirect to forbidden target; redirect loop; redirect limit |
| HTTP behavior | Success; timeout; connection reset; `404`; `429` with bounded retry; provider `5xx`; response over byte limit; wrong declared content type |
| Image parsing | Supported static image; extension/MIME mismatch; corrupt header; truncated data; unsupported format; animation; oversized dimensions; decompression-bomb fixture; decoder crash/limit |
| Text parsing | Empty text; length boundary; combining Unicode; NFKC-equivalent text; embedded NUL; line breaks; quote and punctuation preservation |
| Rights | Complete evidence; missing licence; missing permission; required attribution; linking-only policy; expired permission; later takedown |
| Identity | New content; unchanged revision; changed revision; identical image bytes; identical text; hash-domain separation; near duplicate; shared content with new provenance |
| Durability | Temporary-file failure; whole-manifest rollback after a valid prefix; unresolved manifest blocks other input and publication; same-path replay; interruption before commit; durable directory links; idempotent rerun; disk-full simulation where practical |
| Outcomes | Accepted; unchanged; duplicate; retryable; quarantined; deleted; fatal batch; accurate counts and reasons |

Local record, path, image, text, rights, identity, durability, and outcome cases begin in Phase 1. Network and HTTP cases belong to Phase 4. Network security tests use a controlled local server and resolver stub; they never contact public sources.

The Phase 4 Rust cases exercise the fixed Commons endpoint, required contact identity, plan bounds and pinned metadata, allowed and forbidden resolution, redirect revalidation, bounded bodies, retry exhaustion, API mapping, durable cursor resume, complete-scan removal reconciliation, and bounded JPEG/PNG decoding. Explicit missing pages may tombstone; omissions, top-level API errors, and interrupted scans may not. A separate opt-in live smoke may confirm the reviewed example against Commons, but it is not part of the deterministic test suite.

## Enrichment and artifact matrix — Phases 1, 2, and 4

| Area | Cases |
|---|---|
| Normalization | Corpus and query use the same function/version; original values unchanged; whitespace, case, punctuation, and Unicode boundaries |
| OCR | Good text; low confidence; no text; timeout; non-zero exit; malformed TSV; output limit; human correction kept separately |
| Annotations | Source, model, and human origins preserved; confidence boundary; missing optional field; generated value never marked reviewed |
| Search document | Correct field labels; title/people/template kept distinct; text-only item; image item; empty optional fields |
| Dense artifacts | Expected LSA shape; stable ordered IDs and vocabulary; duplicate or missing ID; dimension mismatch; NaN/infinity; wrong norm; wrong model revision |
| SQLite | Ordered migrations; unsupported schema; failed migration rollback; integrity failure; FTS unavailable; serving rows equal index rows |
| Checksums | Valid artifacts; modified SQLite; modified matrix; modified IDs; canonical content identity stable across timestamps |
| Publication | Valid atomic switch; validation failure leaves old snapshot; failed, incomplete, or unresolved ingest blocks build; bounded media rehash; pre-rename rollback; post-rename fsync reports uncertain durability; missing artifact; ineligible rows absent from the serving database; deletion rebuild |

Run decoder and OCR failure cases inside the same operating-system limits intended for production ingestion.

Phase 1 owns normalization, SQLite, FTS coverage, canonical checksums, and publication. Phase 2 adds TF-IDF/LSA artifacts and retrieval-facing required-file, checksum, version, shape, ID-alignment, finite-value, and norm checks. The selected Phase 4 source does not require OCR or generated annotation, so those cases remain deferred until an implemented source or measured retrieval gap needs them.

## Retrieval matrix — Phase 2

The golden corpus contains distinct items for these searches:

| Query class | Representative case | Expected assertion |
|---|---|---|
| Person/entity | `john cena` | Expected John Cena group appears by rank 3; exact identity evidence is visible |
| Template | `distracted boyfriend` | Expected named template is rank 1 and precedes related dating images |
| Quote/OCR | `you can't see me` | Expected exact/corrected-quote group appears by rank 3 |
| Topic/tag | `wrestling` | Expected wrestling groups appear by rank 5 |
| Semantic concept | `the wrestler nobody can see` | Expected group appears by rank 5 without exact wording |
| Visual description | `man waving hand in front of face` | Expected visual group appears by rank 5 through caption evidence |
| Typo/slang | `jon sena invis meme` | Expected John Cena group appears by rank 10 |
| Multiple cues | `john cena`, `invisible` | Expected group appears by rank 3 and OR-style fusion is deterministic |
| Filters | Image/text, language, and safety boundaries | Only eligible matching items remain |
| Ambiguous query | `drake` | Relevant variants appear with deterministic tie handling |
| No match | Out-of-corpus entity | Empty result, not an unrelated nearest vector |
| Malformed input | Empty, too long, too many cues, invalid filter | Typed validation error before search work |

The implemented Phase 2 suites also cover:

- FTS punctuation, quotes, parentheses, operators, wildcard characters, and Unicode as literal input;
- lexical, dense, and hybrid routes independently;
- deterministic repeat results and duplicate normalized cues;
- exact duplicate collapse in ingestion plus template-group cap/refill in ranking;
- kind/language filters on the serving-only snapshot;
- no-match and fewer-than-limit result sets;
- dense failure with explicit lexical-only degradation;
- corrupt, missing, extra, or version-incompatible artifacts causing startup failure rather than changed rankings;
- errors receiving no empty-result or safety credit.

The larger human benchmark must add explicit route-weight/depth/threshold boundary analysis and deleted/unsafe hard-negative cases before the first complete score. Phase 4 separately verifies that an engine opened before `active.json` is removed or replaced rejects its next search rather than returning a stale row.

## Protocol matrix — Phase 2

The cross-language golden JSON Lines file covers `ready`, `search`, one non-empty `results`, one recoverable `error`, `shutdown`, and `bye`. Rust and Python both decode it. Runtime worker tests additionally cover:

- ready-first handshake and an incompatible protocol version;
- valid search and non-empty result messages;
- recoverable cue validation and a duplicated request ID;
- invalid JSON including Python's integer limit, partial line, oversized line, and premature EOF;
- UTF-8 output under a non-UTF-8 locale;
- immediate failure for oversized input without a terminating newline;
- deterministic tail truncation at the bounded output frame;
- clean `shutdown`/`bye` and diagnostic standard error that cannot corrupt protocol output.

Protocol-version changes require new fixtures rather than silently accepting an incompatible peer.

The Phase 3 Rust client tests cover one worker across search and clean shutdown, timeout plus child reaping, recoverable worker errors without session loss, incompatible protocol and oversized output, result-count limits, worker death, and table-driven rejection of mismatched IDs/versions/routes, invalid ranks, unsafe or unidentified items, duplicate IDs, and invalid item routes.

## TUI matrix — Phase 3

Six pure state/render tests exercise:

| Area | Implemented evidence |
|---|---|
| Input | Unicode typing and deletion, `Ctrl-U`, explicit submit, and blocked resubmission while searching |
| Navigation/actions | Clamped page movement and open/select actions targeting the highlighted stable ID |
| Focus/exit | Results-to-query `Esc`, query-to-quit `Esc`, and global `Ctrl-C` |
| Result states | Empty, recoverable error, fatal error, and the restart action |
| Feedback | Explicit `F2` action, visible enabled state, and no toggle from fatal state |
| Rendering | Wide, narrow, and too-small layouts; Unicode/long fields; missing-image fallback; degradation text |

The Phase 3 PTY script launches the real binary, searches `john cena`, selects the expected rank-one stable ID, and proves the original termios settings, alternate screen, and cursor visibility are restored. Further sessions prove immediate post-render feedback disable, a malformed feedback file cannot block the Ready state or mutate the file, and a worker that closes after a request renders a fatal state and restores the terminal. Panic-path restoration and live resize-event injection are not claimed by this fixture.

## Evaluator matrix — Phase 2

The implemented hand-calculated fixtures cover:

- nDCG with perfect, reversed, empty, and zero-ideal lists;
- ExactMRR with a target at rank two and with none;
- a perfect Technical Score plus combined latency, error, and slice gate failure;
- a route error receiving no empty-result or safety credit;
- paired bootstrap determinism under a fixed seed;
- required benchmark version plus query-family and relevant-item partition isolation.

The Phase 3 profile test covers deterministic shuffled blocks and nearest-rank percentile math. The end-to-end fixture verifies the real PTY boundary, exact warm-up/measurement counts, provenance fields, finite metrics, passing success gates, a deliberately failed reliability gate for an all-error worker, and an intentionally incomplete/null MMTS field. Exhaustive individual MMTS hard-gate and score-bootstrap coverage waits for the independent human-labelled benchmark.

## Interaction-event matrix — Phase 3

Rust unit tests prove that disabled logging creates no file, enabling records a `choose` event with the target rank, Unix directory/file modes are `0700`/`0600`, delete is immediate and idempotent, and 30-day cleanup removes only expired records. The PTY fixture verifies the complete serialized field set plus CLI inspection and deletion against a real selected result.

The schema distinguishes `open`, `copy`, `choose`, `reformulate`, and `abandon`; highlight-only preview is intentionally not an event. The implementation creates random event and launch-scoped session IDs, stores only the opted-in submitted query and ordered returned IDs/ranks, and has no field for viewport exposure, chat context, clipboard content, machine identity, or stable user identity. Raw interaction events do not alter retrieval. Duplicate-ID/version analysis and any learned-ranking experiment require separate offline-analysis tests when that analysis exists.

## Incremental end-to-end fixture

Phase 1 owns the executable-corpus prefix:

```text
local cleared manifest
    -> Rust accepts valid text/image items and quarantines invalid ones
    -> second import is idempotent
    -> duplicate content preserves both provenance records but one searchable item
    -> Python builds and validates deterministic fielded FTS5
    -> snapshot publishes atomically
    -> failed candidate publication leaves the active snapshot unchanged
```

Phase 2 extends that same fixture through retrieval; Phase 3 completes the user workflow:

```text
published Phase 1 snapshot
    -> Phase 2 worker handshake succeeds
    -> Phase 2 headless harness submits "john cena"
    -> expected stable item appears at rank 1
    -> worker shuts down through `bye`
    -> Phase 3 Rust TUI repeats the request
    -> navigation selects the expected stable item ID
    -> optional `choose` interaction records the returned-list rank only when enabled
    -> clean exit restores the terminal
```

Phase 4 adds another offline sequence:

```text
Commons-shaped reviewed source record and bounded image
    -> Rust accepts the item through the shared manifest contract
    -> Python publishes and retrieval finds the planned search metadata
    -> version-2 tombstone ingestion removes active.json
    -> already-open retrieval fails closed
    -> rebuild publishes a corpus without that source item
```

The fixtures always run offline. Phase 1 must reproduce canonical content identity and FTS rows; Phase 2 adds stable rankings; Phase 3 adds stable selection and terminal restoration; Phase 4 adds explicit source-removal and stale-process safety.

## Performance regression checks — Phases 2 through 4

The complete planned performance profile measures:

- worker cold start and model/index load;
- engine p50, p95, and p99 search latency;
- end-to-end query-submit-to-results-render latency;
- concurrency-one search throughput;
- steady and peak resident memory;
- SQLite, vector, and total corpus index size;
- ingestion items per second, p95 item time, and peak memory;
- full and incremental rebuild duration.

Phase 3 implements a release-mode Crossterm PTY profile at an `80x24` viewport and result limit `10`: 128 warm-ups, 1,024 measurements, equally repeated queries in deterministic shuffled blocks, and result caching disabled. Timing spans the Searching-state write through the completed result/error-state write and includes the controller channel, 10 ms polling, worker protocol, validation, and Crossterm output. The report pins corpus/retriever/snapshot identities, records environment provenance, counts request errors, and charges timeouts at least five seconds. Physical key delivery and terminal-emulator paint remain outside that interface boundary. Phase 4 reports source-acquisition duration, sequential throughput, retries, bytes, freshness, and peak memory separately, along with corpus size and search-regression evidence.

## Phase gates

| Close | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Rust and Python suites; local ingestion/build integration; idempotence; quarantine and duplicate outcomes; FTS coverage; checksum stability; publication rollback |
| Phase 2 | Phase 1 regression; protocol and retrieval suites; evaluator fixtures; provisional public benchmark; BM25/dense/hybrid comparison; explicit semantic decision; MMTS readiness remains incomplete |
| Phase 3 source release | Phase 2 regression; TUI state/rendering; worker lifecycle; interaction privacy; offline full fixture; PTY restoration; interface profile; MMTS explicitly remains incomplete without hidden human safety labels |
| Phase 4 | First-release regression on the enlarged corpus; external-source contract; controlled network security; resume/retry; update/deletion; throughput and resource report |

Rights, provenance, safety, and artifact-integrity violations block every phase. A later phase never weakens an earlier phase's gate.
